### Description:

This project explores a problem of loading cargo onto a ship. In general,
our goal is to load the heaviest cargo while keeping the volume of total
cargo under a specified limit. To solve this problem, this program uses the
greedy and exhaustive algorithms which both take in a vector of goods and a
double representing the volume limit.
